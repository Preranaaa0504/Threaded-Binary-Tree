# Threaded-Binary-Tree
TBT stands for "Threaded Binary Tree," a type of binary tree that includes additional links (threads) to facilitate efficient traversal without recursion or a stack. These threads allow for quick navigation between nodes during traversal operations, such as inorder traversal.
